## 🚀 How to Use

1. Adjust **Password Length** with the slider.
2. Turn **Include numbers** / **Include symbols** on or off.

> Note: Clipboard copy works best when the project is opened via `http://localhost` (for example using VS Code Live Server), because some browsers block clipboard access on `file://`.
